This is my another approach to automatic Arch Linux installation and
configuration.

This branch is a test of storing multiple machines configuration files
in a single branch, within directories next to each other.
Ultimately, if the test proves this approach is better than having each machine
stored in a different branch, the master branch should look like this branch.

Additionally, code refactoring, unification and simplification of functions
should be done, where possible.
