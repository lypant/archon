This is my another approach to automatic Arch Linux installation and configuration.

TODO:
- Group color theme color settings defines into single script; use in other
    scripts by including and using defined names
- Check urxvt, console, etc. to use Polish letters
- Programs/packages to install:
    - cmus + libmad - audio playback
        - solarized theme for cmus
- Implement TODOs from scripts
